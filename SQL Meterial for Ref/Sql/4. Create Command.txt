DDL (Data Definition Language):

create command:
-----------------------
create table 
--- A table will be used to store relavent data in the database.
--- A table will have number of columns in it.
--- data in table is stored in the form of rows
--- Table can hold more than one row of data.
-- columns in the table can have different datatypes in it
naming standards to create a table
to create a table in the database relevant or identifiable name specific to its purpose should be proived so that it can be recognized.
eg: student ,school
best practice is to include the projectname ,module name in the table name 
oracle allows maximum of 30 characters in the table name.
underscores(_) can be used to differentiate a table name like sch_student_record.. etc...
proper shortcuts (understandable ) should be used in names.
table name should be unique (oracle doesnot allow multiple tables with same name).
sch_lib_student ---> XXX_XXX_XXXX
project_module_tableName

to create a table syntax

create table tablename (column1 datatype(size),column2 datatype(size)......... );

create tables in the database 
steps
1.install oracle in the system
2. the oracle should be up and running.
3.go the command prompt 
type sqlplus
enter User name

SQL>

command to see how many tables are present in the database user 
SQL> select * from tab;
it will display all the tables present in the database .
from SQL if want to change to other user 
SQL> conn username

if both matches then the new user will be connected.
query to create a table
create table sch_student ( stud_id number(3),studname varchar2(40),stud_age number(3) , stud_class varchar2(20));

it creates a table with 4 columns with no data in it .
 to see the structure of the table once it has been created use the 'desc' command
desc tablename;
SQL> desc sch_student;
it returns the table information like the column names, whether the column is nullable or not and the datatypes and size specified to each column.

create command types 
-------------------------------
create table from existing table 

create table new_tablename as select columnList from existing_tablename .
example: 
create table student_copy as select * from student;
 the above command will create a new table student_copy with all the columns present in the student table and also all the rows (data ) will also be copied.

creating a new user :
---------------------------
syntax:
create  user <user_name> identified by <password>

query to student orbit user with orbit password.

create user orbit identified by orbit;

>> once a user is created then it should be granted to connect to DB .
query to grant connect :
grant connect to orbit;
>> to perform operations ( creating , alter, droping ,selecting etc  )on DB objects (table ,views etc) the user need resources to be granted .
resources are granted by :
sql>grant resources to orbit ;
