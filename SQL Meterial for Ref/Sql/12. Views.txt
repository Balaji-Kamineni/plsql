VIEWS
=====
-> A view is an object, which is a logical representation of a table.

-> A view contains no data on its own

-> It is derived from tables

-> Changes made in tables are automatically reflected in views

-> As a view does not store any data the redundancy problem does not arise.

-> Critical data in the base table is safeguarded as access to such data can be controlled.

-> It is used to reduce the complexity of the query

In Oracle we can create different types of views

1) SIMPLE                                              
2) COMPLEX                                
3) INLINE

SIMPLE view is a view, which is created using only one base table.

COMPLEX view is a view, which is created using more than one table or using group functions.

INLINE view is a view, which is created using sub query (it is not a schema object.) 

• It is a named sub query in the FROM clause of the main query. Generally used in TOP N Analysis.

SYNTAX
CREATE OR REPLACE [FORCE]  VIEW <VIEWNAME> AS SELECT <COLUMNS> FROM <TABLE > [WITH READ ONLY] [WITH CHECK OPTION];

The table on which a view is based is called as base table
FORCE option allows view to be created even if the base table doesn’t exist. However, the base table should exist before the view is used.

Changing Base Table through view
--------------------------------
A view can also be used to change the data of base table
A view can be used to delete, insert and update rows in the base table.

Example  
SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW TESTVIEW47473 AS SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL FROM EMP47473;
Note: - These views are stored in a data dictionary table USER_VIEWS

SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW TESTVIEW47473 AS SELECT  EMPNO,ENAME,SAL FROM EMP47473 WITH READ ONLY;

[WITH READ ONLY | WITH CHECK OPTION]

This option is used to prevent any changes to base table through view. Insertion and updation is not allowed into base table through view.

SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW CHKVIEW AS SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO = 20 WITH CHECK OPTION;

It doesn’t allow you to update the condition column as well as it doesn’t allow you to insert the details of employees with DEPTNO other than 20.

To remove a view

SQL> DROP VIEW <VIEWNAME>;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_empdept
AS
SELECT e.EmpNo,e.Ename,e.Job,e.Sal,e.DeptNo,d.DName,d.Loc
FROM
Emp e, Dept D
WHERE
e.DeptNo=d.DeptNo
