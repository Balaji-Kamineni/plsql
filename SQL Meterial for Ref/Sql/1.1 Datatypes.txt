Oracle Datatypes

Each column value and constant in a SQL statement has a data type, which is associated with a specific storage format, constraints, and a valid range of values. When you create a table, you must specify a data type for each of its columns. Oracle provides the following built-in data types.

1) Char:* it can accommodate the alphanumeric data
	* The Default and min size is 1 byte(1 character)
	* Max size is 256 bytes

	  sname char(10)

2) Varchar2 : 
* It can accommodate the alphanumeric data
* The size must be specified
* Max size is 4000 bytes
	
address varchar2(20)

3) Number :
	* Holds only numeric data.
	* Max , default size is 38 digits.
	
	Syntax:  number (scale, [precession])

	Ex : price in a supermarket
                              Price number (6,2)
4) Date: 
	*Holds date and time values	
	*Default & fixed size is 7 bytes
	*Default date format is dd-mon-yy
			  (12-Mar-08)
5) Long :

* Holds huge amt. of textual information
* Max. Size is 2 G.B
	
 Restrictions:

* We can't use this for multiple times. Only one time/table we can use 
* The long field must not be indexed
* We must not give the unique constraint on it.

6) LOBS ( Large Objects):
	
BLOB    : Binary Large Object
CLOB    : Character Large Object
NCLOB   : Used to hold multi byte character set
BFILE   : Binary File
